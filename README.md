Hi, I'm Tone NordstrÃ¶m!    

I'm a curious and solution-driven .NET developer who loves diving deep into code and figuring out how things really work.  
Backend is my happy place (C#, .NET, SQL/T-SQL, Azure), but I also have experience with frontend and enjoy fullstack when needed.    

Iâ€™m currently learning:  
Azure Platform & Cloud Services: Setting up and managing virtual machines, automating tasks with Azure CLI, and working with Azure Portal.  
Platform as a Service (PaaS): Creating and deploying App Services, using Cloud Shell, and integrating Git-based deployments.  
Monitoring & Debugging: Leveraging Application Insights and tools like Project Kudu for performance tracking and troubleshooting.    

I'm especially excited to delve deeper into cloud databases and learn how to optimize data solutions in the cloud!     

Feel free to reach out if you want to talk code, collaborate on a project, or challenge me to a game of chess!
