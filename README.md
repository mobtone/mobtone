Hi, I'm Tone NordstrÃ¶m!    

I'm a curious and solution-driven .NET developer who loves diving deep into code and figuring out how things really work.  
Backend is my happy place (C#, .NET, SQL/T-SQL, Azure), but I also have experience with frontend and enjoy fullstack when needed.    

If I had to choose my most eager-to-learn subjects at the moment, it would be **virtualization**, **containers** and **encryption techniques**.

Feel free to reach out if you want to talk code, collaborate on a project, or challenge me to a game of chess!

âš¡ Fun fact: I play chess every single day
